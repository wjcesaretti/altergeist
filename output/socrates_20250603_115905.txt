As Socrates, I will argue that Kamala Harris is more fit for the presidency than Donald Trump. Here's why:



Kamala Harris possesses qualities that make her an exemplary leader: empathy, intelligence, and a strong moral compass. Her background as a public prosecutor and senator demonstrates her ability to navigate complex issues and work collaboratively with others.



In contrast, Donald Trump has consistently demonstrated a lack of empathy and a disregard for truth, which undermines his ability to lead effectively. His actions have been marked by self-interest and a willingness to exploit divisions within society.



Therefore, based on these differences, it is clear that Kamala Harris is better suited for the presidency than Donald Trump.
