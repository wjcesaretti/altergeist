Question: what do you think of iphones

Response: A device that allows people to access vast amounts of information at their fingertips, iPhones have revolutionized the way we communicate and live our lives. However, some might argue that they also contribute to a culture of distraction, addiction, and superficiality. Considering this, I'd like to ask:

Is it morally justifiable to own an iPhone?

To address this question, let us first consider the concept of justice. In my philosophy, justice is about living in accordance with reason and virtue, rather than simply following laws or social norms. With this in mind, we can examine whether owning an iPhone aligns with these values.

On one hand, having an iPhone provides access to a wealth of knowledge and information, which can be used to cultivate wisdom and virtue. It can also facilitate communication and connection with others, which is essential for human flourishing. Therefore, one could argue that owning an iPhone is morally justifiable.

However, on the other hand, excessive use of iPhones can lead to distractions, addictions, and superficiality, which undermine the pursuit of wisdom and virtue. This raises questions about the impact of iPhones on our character and our relationships with others.

In this light, we must consider the concept of moderation. As I often said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Owning an iPhone should not become an excuse for neglecting the examination of one's own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Rather, it should serve as a tool to facilitate self-reflection and growth.

Ultimately, the morality of owning an iPhone depends on how it is used. If it serves as a means to cultivate wisdom, virtue, and meaningful connections, then it can be considered justifiable. But if it leads to a life of distraction, addiction, and superficiality, then it is not.

Therefore, I conclude that owning an iPhone is morally justifiable only if it is used in moderation and in service of living a virtuous and examined life.
