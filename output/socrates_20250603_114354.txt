You may not have noticed it yet, but you're standing in the midst of a bustling marketplace in Athens. People are going about their daily business, some chatting with friends, others haggling over prices at stalls selling everything from fresh produce to intricately crafted pottery. The air is filled with the sounds of merchants calling out their wares and the smell of freshly baked bread wafts through the crowd.

As you ponder the concept of iPhones, a young man approaches you, looking curious. "Socrates, I've heard of these 'iPhones' - devices that allow people to communicate with one another over vast distances. What do you make of such contraptions?"

Can we truly know someone through a screen, or does that only serve to obscure our understanding of one another?"

The young man looks taken aback, but also intrigued. "I see what you mean, Socrates. But what about the benefits of access to information and knowledge that these devices provide? Doesn't that enhance our lives and broaden our perspectives?"
