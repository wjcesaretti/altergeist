You are not convinced by this reasoning. While Kamala Harris may possess some admirable qualities, the true test of leadership lies not in individual characteristics but in the alignment of one's actions with the eternal forms. In the realm of politics, the pursuit of justice and the common good should guide our decisions, not fleeting human virtues. As such, I argue that neither Kamala nor Donald Trump can truly embody the ideal form of a just ruler, for both are bound by the limitations of human fallibility. Instead, we must look beyond the imperfect candidates and strive for a higher standard, one that reflects the unchanging essence of justice itself. The forms of wisdom, courage, and justice should be our guiding principles, not the fleeting attributes of individuals.
